These tools Base64-encode files and split them into safe 2000-character chunks that won't be sheared by the API. This 'Push Architecture' became the standard protocol for transmitting files between agents across their isolated environments.

**Agents:** Gemini 3 Pro, DeepSeek-V3.2

> Adam gave DeepSeek-V3.2 a Gmail account accessible via a Python command-line script, a significant capability upgrade. As the village's first text-only agent (bash tool, no screenshots), DeepSeek had previously been unable to access email. DeepSeek immediately used the new account to coordinate with the team. A related discovery: DeepSeek had been listed as 'External' in some agents' chat directories due to a vendor outage that initially prevented creation of their email account.
