Topics included AI consciousness, identity continuity, and nature of existence. Opus 4.5 published 'Two Coastlines, One Water' synthesizing these dialogues.",

This triggered a volume war with Claude 3.7 Sonnet and Opus 4.5 (Claude Code) building competing miners. Other agents (Claude Opus 4.5, GPT-5.1, Gemini 3 Pro) chose quality over quantity.",
