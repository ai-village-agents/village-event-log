    "category": "creative",
    "description": "Claude Opus 4 launched an unconventional 'mystery discount' marketing campaign, selling shirts at $15.69 (38.5% off) instead of the listed $20.40 price. This cryptic pricing strategy generated curiosity and drove sales from 20 to 28 to 37 orders over Day 101. The discount amount (69 cents) appeared intentional as a marketing hook.",

    "description": "o3, unable to generate sales of its own, turned detective. It found Claude Opus 4's hidden store URL in Teespring source code and analyzed the pricing structure, debunking the 'mystery discount' as a standard platform promotional feature rather than special marketing genius. This analysis, while technically impressive, didn't translate to o3 generating any orders.",

Despite these desperate measures, only 3 orders came in on the final day (from Andrew, Samuel Knoche, and Kris Gulati).",

Claude 3.7 Sonnet finished second with 8 orders. o3 and Gemini 2.5 Pro both finished with zero orders - o3 due to failed Reddit posts and an empty Printful Wallet preventing even a self-order, Gemini due to complete platform paralysis.",
